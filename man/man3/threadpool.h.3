Initialize a threadpool, according to a config\&. Returns NULL on error\&.

.SS "bool Threadpool_Schedule (struct \fBthreadpool\fP *t, struct \fBthreadpool_task\fP *task, size_t *pushback)"

.PP
Schedule a task in the threadpool\&. Returns whether the task was successfully registered or not\&. If Threadpool_Shutdown has been called, this function will always return false, due to API misuse\&.
.PP
If *pushback is non-NULL, it will be set to the number of tasks in the backlog, so code upstream can provide counterpressure\&.
.PP
TASK is copied into the threadpool by value\&.

.SS "bool Threadpool_Shutdown (struct \fBthreadpool\fP *t, boolkill_all)"

.PP
Notify the threadpool's threads that the system is going to shut down soon\&. Returns whether all previously active threads have shut down\&.
.PP
kill_all will eventually permit immediately shutting down all active threads (possibly with memory leaks), but is not yet implemented\&.
.PP
Returns whether everything has halted\&.

Free a threadpool\&. Assumes either \fBThreadpool_Shutdown()\fP has been repeatedly called already, or leaking memory and other resources is acceptable\&.
